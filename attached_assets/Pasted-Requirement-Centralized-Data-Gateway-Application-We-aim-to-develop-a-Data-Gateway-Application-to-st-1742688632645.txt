Requirement: Centralized Data Gateway Application
We aim to develop a Data Gateway Application to streamline and centralize our PGP encryption and decryption processes for Inbound and Outbound file transfers. Currently, these processes are fragmented, making tracking and management inefficient.

Existing Process Overview:
Vendors upload PGP-encrypted files to our SFTP server, which are then transferred to Azure Storage.

A Python script (running in an Azure Function App) handles PGP decryption for inbound files.

For outbound files, we encrypt them using the vendorâ€™s PGP public key before sending them.

Vendors belong to different vendor types (e.g., Subservicers), and each vendor requires PGP key pair generation and storage.

Currently, there is no centralized system to manage these processes, track file movements, or monitor encryption/decryption activities.

Two Core Processes:
Inbound Process (PGP Decryption)

Vendors upload PGP-encrypted files to the SFTP server.

Files are transferred to Azure Storage.

A Python script automatically decrypts the files and moves them to the appropriate storage location.

Outbound Process (PGP Encryption)

Files that need to be sent to vendors are PGP-encrypted using their public key.

Encrypted files are uploaded to the SFTP server for vendors to retrieve.

Challenges:
âœ… Decentralized Process â€“ No unified control over encryption, decryption, and file transfers.
âœ… Lack of a Centralized Dashboard â€“ No visibility into file processing, encryption status, or error logs.
âœ… Vendor & Key Management Issues â€“ Each vendor requires a PGP key pair, but key generation and storage are not centralized.

Proposed Solution:
We want to build a FastAPI-based web application with a UI Dashboard that will:
âœ” Centralize Management â€“ Track vendors, key pairs, file processing, and logs in one place.
âœ” Automate PGP Key Generation & Storage â€“ Generate PGP key pairs for vendors and store them securely in Azure Key Vault.
âœ” Handle File Encryption & Decryption â€“ Manage both Inbound (decryption) and Outbound (encryption) processes.
âœ” Support Ad-hoc Decryption â€“ Allow users to manually decrypt files when needed.

Dashboard & Monitoring Features:
ðŸ“Œ File Tracking

View all received files (Inbound) and sent files (Outbound) with timestamps.

Track which vendor uploaded/downloaded files.

ðŸ“Œ Encryption & Decryption Statistics

Number of files decrypted (Inbound) and encrypted (Outbound).

Success vs. failure rates for decryption/encryption.

ðŸ“Œ Recent Activity Logs

Monitor real-time file processing status for both Inbound & Outbound.

View logs of recent encryption and decryption activities.

ðŸ“Œ Failure/Error Reports

Display failed decryption and encryption attempts with error details.

Allow manual retry or investigation options for failed operations.

This solution will provide better automation, monitoring, and security, ensuring seamless encryption and decryption workflows while maintaining complete visibility.
